                    <h4>Audio Equalizer</h4>
                    <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/109888157?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ebf0f5" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>This was an individual project that was designed and completed independently. The circuit is able to take an input signal such as audio and separate it into three bands of frequencies: bass, mid, and treble. The circuit allows the user to control the volume of each band of frequency to change the characteristics of the audio. The signal is amplified and outputted into a speaker.</p>

                    <h4>Single Photon Image Sensor</h4>
                    <p>This is an ongoing senior project with a team of six members. The design for the chip is a single photon detector with a frame rate of 1M FPS. The chip is currently being tested on a PCB and with LabView.</p>

                    <h4>Memory Storage Device</h4>
                    <p>This was an individual project. Microcontrollers, PIC and Arduino, were used to interface with a SD card and serial flash chip. Data can be written and extracted from the card by using serial peripheral interface. The project was used to extract the data from a stored audio file and to convey the information using pulse width modulation.</p>

                    <h4>Tetris</h4>
                    <p>This was an individual project. A microcontroller, PIC, was used to control a led matrix to simulate a game of Tetris. The rules, user interface, and algorithms for the game was coded in C language using MPLABX.</p>

                    <h4>Mini Rose Float Parade</h4>
                    <p>The project consisted of fifteen members. The team was divided into smaller groups that worked on a specific aspect of the float. I worked in a group of three that was responsible for the animations of the rose float.</p>
